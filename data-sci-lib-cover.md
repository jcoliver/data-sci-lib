Dear Professor Kaspar,

On behalf of my coauthors, I am submitting this manuscript, titled "Data Science Support at the Academic Library" for possible publication in _College & Research Libraries_. The work details the timely opportunity for providing data science support to researchers through the college and university library.

The interdisciplinary field of data science is providing a wealth of applications across scientific domains. Harnessing advances in computational, statistical, and data resources, data science affords the transformation of big data to new knowledge and innovative solutions. Researchers across disciplines have a growing appreciation for data science yet often lack the support and training resources to capitalize on data science applications. This growing body of unmet needs presents several opportunities for college and research libraries.

The academic library is uniquely poised to provide support in several aspects of data science. A natural campus hub, the academic library serves all campus disciplines and is a repository of expertise for data-intensive work. In the current manuscript, we describe several potential points of engagement where library expertise can support data science literacy. We describe three successful programs at the University of Arizona Libraries, as well as strategic partnerships with units external to the library, that support campus-level data science training. We close with recommendations for developing the human capital necessary for impactful data science support programs.

There are several people who could provide insightful feedback on this work, including Tobin Magle (tobin.magle@colostate.edu), Jennifer Garrett (jigarret@ncsu.edu), Chris Erdmann (chris@carpentries.org), Matt Burton (mburton@pitt.edu), and Victoria Steeves (vs77@nyu.edu).

Thank you again for your consideration of this manuscript. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at jcoliver@email.arizona.edu. I look forward to working with you toward the publication of this work.

Sincerely,
