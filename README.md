### Structure
+ Introduction to data science (and parallel efforts e.g. digital scholarship) needs
    + Intro to data science and the needs of researchers / students / workforce
    + Data science training needed, often siloed or inaccessible to most; describe the void (see white paper for some language); use Barone et al. 2017 [10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005755](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005755) for support
    + (Current support in most libraries? digital scholarship)
    + Summarize the paper, talking about how UAL has been filling void, and acknowledge the challenges
+ Supporting data science
    + Introductory paragraph for the section; brief secrets of success
    + Areas of specialization
        + R
            + Workshop formats
            + In-depth consulting, focusing on the life sciences
        + GIS
            + Software support
            + Data support
            + Workshops / drop-ins
        + Data Management / Reproducibility
            + Data management for post-docs work shop
            + Reproducibility, including OSF
            + Software preservation?
        + Promotion / advertising - e-mail and word of mouth
    + Partnerships (space, resources, library as hub)
        + UITS machine learning, big data (space, marketing)
        + CyVerse (Carpentries, ResBaz)
+ Challenges
    + How do build out services
        + Personnel investment
            + Hiring new
                + Who to hire? Scientists?
                + UA did this (JCO: Ph.D. in biology, BH: M.S. in Geography, JFR: Ph.D. in Geography, M.S. in Comp. Sci.)
                + New training programs for data science librarians?
                    + [Syracuse University](http://ischool.syr.edu/future/cas/datascience.aspx)
                    + [UC Berkeley](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/)
            + Training current
                + [NCSU's Data Science and Visualization Institute for Librarians](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/datavizinstitute)
                + Library Carpentry (UA does this)
    + Why should the library do this?
        + Internal: it is not "traditional" library stuff
        + External: why not computer science, IT, or stats depts?
+ Closing summary
    + Future directions (like what type of research might be done around this area)

### Relevant citations
+ Barbrow et al. 2017. Talk about a few data science related resources (like mailing lists). Not really clear how many are really data science.

### People
+ [Sarah Young](https://www.library.cmu.edu/about/people/sarah-young), Liaison to Stats & Data Science et al., Carnegie Mellon University Libraries
+ [Jennifer Garrett](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/staff/jigarret), Head of Digital Research Education & Training, North Carolina State University

### Outstanding questions
+ Who is the audience?
    + Library administrators
+ What journal? _College & Research Libraries_
+ Stuff to cover
    + What data science is
    + Why the libraries make sense
    + How broadly -> specifics
    + Who to hire
    + It is disruptive
        + Within the library (xenophobia)
        + Outside the library (territoriality)

From Librarian-Roles project (merged here)
+ What is the role of the library in computational literacy?
+ Should librarians teach scientists to code?
    + If so, to what degree?
    + If not, why not?
+ Text excerpts:
    + As academic libraries adapt to the changing information landscape, the
    services provided by librarians are also changing.
    + Where card catalogs once stood are 3-D printers; literature is often
    retrieved through a web browser instead of a shelf; and
