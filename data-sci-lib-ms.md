# Introduction
The interdisciplinary field of data science is emerging as one of the fastest growing endeavors on and off college campuses [**REFS**]. Data science, which applies concepts from statistics and computer sciences to questions numerous domains, is driving novel discoveries across disciplines [**REFS**]. Such applications include [list three, e.g. machine learning in linguistics, social science application, health sciences - disease predictors]. However, applying such approaches requires specialized skills and resources [**LIST SKILLS**] [**REFS**]. The absence of comprehensive data science support at many academic institutions is creating a growing list of unmet needs (Oliver 2017(?); Barone et al. 2017) [**REFS**], preventing many researchers from taking advantage of the big data revolution [_REWORD_?].

A number of factors are contributing to the gap in skills and resources necessary to capitalize on data science applications. The first is the relative youth of data science; while the field has arguably existed for decades [**REFS**], it has only recently attracted widespread attention across academic disciplines [**REFS**]. Many researchers are only now realizing the necessity of skills development (Barone et al. 2017), and they are often in positions where formal training is especially challenging (e.g. post-doctoral or faculty positions) [**REFS**]. Also contributing to the gap is an absence of training opportunities (**Wilson "Lessons Learned"**), often due to a lack of interest in teaching "remedial" computer programming courses [_REWORD_]. When training is offered, it often suffers from "siloing" observed on many campuses, where IT departments teach to one audience, libraries teach to another, and computer science departments teach to yet another [**REFS**]. Efforts are underway to support researchers' needs, such as Software and Data Carpentry workshops [**REFS**], yet there remain significant deficiencies in resources to support the development of data science literacy on many, if not most, campuses.

Supporting data science efforts presents an opportunity for academic library engagement. Libraries serve as hubs for college and university campuses, and like the field of data science, are by definition interdisciplinary. The audience for an academic library is also arguably larger than that of any other campus unit: the library serves the _entire campus_, including students, staff, and faculty. Supporting aspects of data science in the library is not new; indeed, libraries have been supporting collection, management, and sharing best practices for many years [**REFS**] (Antell et al. 2014). Additionally, many academic libraries have been supporting researchers with computational and statistical skills (e.g. OSU Library site, NCST Library site). With this in mind, now is an opportune time for academic libraries to explicitly address the growing need for data science training.

In this paper, we describe how the University of Arizona Libraries has been meeting data science needs by promoting skills and resources development. A number of approaches, including internal and external partnerships have been essential in developing a successful program. Next, we introduce some internal and external challenges libraries will face when developing support for the data sciences and propose some solutions. We close with a brief discussion of unanswered questions about the roles libraries may play in driving data science literacy efforts [_REWORD_].

# Supporting data science
The University of Arizona Libraries (UAL) has significantly expanded support for data science skills development. This includes hiring additional library staff, developing digital materials, and forming new partnerships with other intramural and extramural units. The success of these efforts is evident in growing participation in library offerings (see below), and has relied on determining which areas of data science are appropriate for the library to support and which areas are better suited for our partners outside of the library.

## Areas of emphasis within the library
Investment in data sciences at UAL has supported growth in a number of areas, but three in particular have been especially popular on the University of Arizona campus. These heavily rely on the expertise of library staff, including deep domain knowledge in areas outside the library and information sciences. All three efforts have been successful by rapidly responding to campus needs, refining support offerings in response to the changing research landscape.
