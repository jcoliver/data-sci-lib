# Introduction
+ Intro to data science and the needs of researchers / students / workforce
+ Data science training needed, often siloed or inaccessible to most; describe the void (see white paper for some language); use Barone et al. 2017 [10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005755](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005755) for support
+ (Efforts so far, including "Shifting to Data Savvy...")
+ Summarize the paper, talking about how UAL has been filling void, and acknowledge the challenges

The interdisciplinary field of data science is emerging as one of the fastest growing endeavors on and off college campuses [**REFS**]. Data science, which applies concepts from statistics and computer sciences to questions numerous domains, is driving novel discoveries across disciplines [**REFS**]. Such applications include [list three, e.g. machine learning in linguistics, social science application, health sciences - disease predictors]. However, applying such approaches requires specialized skills and resources [**LIST SKILLS**] [**REFS**]. The absence of comprehensive data science support at many academic institutions is creating a growing list of unmet needs (Oliver 2017(?); Barone et al. 2017) [**REFS**], preventing many researchers from taking advantage of the big data revolution [_REWORD_?].

A number of factors are contributing to the gap in skills and resources necessary to capitalize on data science applications. The first is the relative youth of data science; while the field has arguably existed for decades [**REFS**], it has only recently attracted widespread attention across academic disciplines [**REFS**]. Many researchers are only now realizing the necessity of skills development (Barone et al. 2017), and they are often in positions where formal training is especially challenging (e.g. post-doctoral or faculty positions) [**REFS**]. Also contributing to the gap is an absence of training opportunities (Wilson "Lessons Learned"), often due to a lack of interest in teaching "remedial" computer programming courses [_REWORD_]. When training is offered, it often suffers from "siloing" observed on many campuses, where IT departments teach to one audience, libraries teach to another, and computer science departments teach to yet another [**REFS**]. Efforts are underway to support researchers' needs, such as Software and Data Carpentry workshops [**REFS**], there remain significant deficiencies in resources to support the development of data science literacy on many, if not most, campuses.

Supporting data science efforts presents an opportunity for academic library engagement. In this paper, we describe how the University of Arizona Libraries has promoted data science skills and resources development. A number of approaches, including internal and external partnerships have been essential in developing a successful program. Next, we introduce some internal and external challenges libraries will face when developing support for the data sciences and propose some solutions. We close with a brief discussion of unanswered questions about the roles libraries may play in driving data science literacy efforts [_REWORD_].
