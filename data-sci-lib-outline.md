# Data Science Support at the Academic Library
## Outline
### Last update: 2018-04-19

+ Introduction to data science needs
    + Intro to data science and the needs of researchers / students / workforce
    + Data science training needed, often siloed or inaccessible to most; 
    describe the void (see white paper for some language); use Barone et al. 
    2017 [10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005755](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005755) 
    for support
    + (Current support in most libraries? digital scholarship)
        + Academic libraries can contribute greatly to data science training
        + Libraries as hubs, drawing diverse audiences (by definition 
          interdisciplinary)
        + Libraries already involved in data management for a while now
        + Libraries serve entire campus, can reach very broad audience
    + Summarize the paper, talking about how UAL has been filling void, and 
    acknowledge the challenges
+ Supporting data science
    + Introductory paragraph for the section; brief secrets of success
    + Areas of specialization
        + R
            + Workshop formats
            + In-depth consulting, focusing on the life sciences
        + GIS
            + Software support
            + Data support
            + Workshops / drop-ins
        + Data Management / Reproducibility
            + Data management for post-docs work shop
            + Reproducibility, including OSF
            + Software preservation?
        + Promotion / advertising - e-mail and word of mouth
    + Partnerships (space, resources, library as hub)
        + DSRT
        + UITS machine learning, big data (space, marketing)
        + CyVerse (Carpentries, ResBaz)
+ Challenges
    + How do build out services
        + Personnel investment
            + Hiring new
                + Who to hire? Scientists?
                + UA did this (JCO: Ph.D. in biology, BH: M.S. in Geography, 
                  FR: Ph.D. in Geography, M.S. in Comp. Sci.)
                + New training programs for data science librarians?
                    + [Syracuse University](http://ischool.syr.edu/future/cas/datascience.aspx)
                    + [UC Berkeley](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/)
            + Training current
                + [NCSU's Data Science and Visualization Institute for Librarians](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/datavizinstitute)
                + Library Carpentry (UA does this)
                + Librarians should learn to code? [Rosati 2016](https://dx.doi.org/10.5931/djim.v12.i1.6450)
    + Why should the library do this?
        + Internal: it is not "traditional" library stuff
        + External: why not computer science, IT, or stats depts?
+ Closing summary
    + Future directions (like what type of research might be done around this 
      area)
